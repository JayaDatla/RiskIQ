## 🔍 Testing

The application has been tested and verified:
- ✅ All dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Backend API imports working
- ✅ Frontend files present
- ✅ Main app creation successful
- ✅ All routes configured properly

## 📱 Mobile Support

Fully responsive design works on:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Model Files
- The application expects model files in `backend/model_store/`
- If models are missing, the app will use fallback calculations
- For production, ensure models are included in the deployment

### API Keys
- Perplexity API key is optional (set via environment variable)
- Without API key, the app uses rule-based summaries
- Set `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` in HF Spaces secrets if needed

### Performance
- First load may take 30-60 seconds (model loading)
- Subsequent requests are much faster
- Consider upgrading hardware for better performance

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!
